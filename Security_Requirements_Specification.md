## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security requirements for the Web-Based Grading System (Acadex), a comprehensive academic management platform built on the Laravel framework. The system manages student records, grades, academic periods, and educational data across multiple user roles including Administrators, Deans, Chairpersons, and Instructors.

The security requirements are structured around the fundamental principles of Information Security: **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** (CIA triad), ensuring comprehensive protection of sensitive academic data and maintaining system reliability.
